          Floating through time and space, the Guardian collects energy to be
          able to access one dimension after other, to spread a universal
          message of hope and balance to all who dwell simultaneously across
          Dimensions. 
          <h6 id="instruction"> Use your arrows to collect energy to access the next
          dimension. Keep in mind, purple is the color of peace and magic. 
          Collecting five at a time will give you the power of space to be sacred for a moment of time.
          Avoid the obstacles.</h6>
