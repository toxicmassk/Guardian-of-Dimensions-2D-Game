# Guardian-of-Dimensions-2D-Game

![GuardianOfDimensionsStartScreen](GuardianOfDimensionsStartScreen.png)

Floating through time and space, the Guardian collects energy to be able to access one dimension after other, to spread a universal message of hope and balance to all who dwell simultaneously across Dimensions.

This is my first 2-D Game I created using HTML5, Canvas, JS, Jquery & CSS3. I created all Sounddesign in that game.
